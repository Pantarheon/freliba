# FRELIBA
_Je liba freliba?_

A collection of `frei0r` plugins using
[libkoliba](https://github.com/Pantarheon/libkoliba).
It is also considered an essential software part of the
[koliba](https://github.com/Pantarheon/koliba)
video editing system, as well as a teaching tool for software
developers to see how to use various parts of
[libkoliba](https://github.com/Pantarheon/libkoliba) in their
own projects.


I wrote most of these in 2019, while porting the functionality of
my `Palette Mallet` OFX plug-in to a library, to test whether the
library works in my Raspberry Pi (_if you make it there, youâ€™ll
make it anywhere_). And yes, it does.

Then in early 2020 my health deteriorated so badly, I was unable
to continue working on `libkoliba`, let alone on `freliba` (and no,
I did not have Covid-19, thankfully). It took more than a year of
all kinds of therapy (including spending two hours a day, five days
a week, for ten weeks, inside a hyperbaric oxygen chamber). Eventually,
in mid-2021 I was able to start working on `libkoliba` again.

Anyway, it should be clear that if you want to use `freliba`, first
you need to download and install
[libkoliba](https://github.com/Pantarheon/libkoliba). After that,
you can compile and install `freliba` which will add a number of
[frei0r plug-ins](https://github.com/dyne/frei0r) to your system.
You can use them with `ffmpeg`, with `kdenlive`, and with aything
else that can use `frei0r` plug-ins.
